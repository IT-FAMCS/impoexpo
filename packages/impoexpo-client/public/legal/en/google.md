# privacy policy (Google integrations)

impoexpo integrates with Google's services for productivity purposes, for example by reading a form's responses and transforming them into a new format. this means that we must access and process some of your personal data.

## what data we access

our integrations access the **smallest amount of data possible** to function properly.

* **Google Forms**: the form layout and responses for the specific form you select.
* **Google Drive**: the files on your Drive may be read so that you don't have to pick the required file manually. **we never delete, modify, or transfer your files; this is a read-only operation.**

## how we use your data

impoexpo lets the user define how they use and process their data. we provide the raw data from Google's APIs (after converting it into a format that works with impoexpo's graph editor), and all control is passed to the user.

## how we share and store your data

impoexpo and the team behind it doesn't have third-party partners, so your data is not shared with anyone but our server for processing. we don't store **any** of your data on our servers. all processing happens in-memory and the data is never retained. if any tokens are passed between the server and the client, they are cryptographically encrypted beforehand and are stored securely in your browser.
